# p62–PD-L1–LLPS Starter (v2, 2025-11-01)

This upgrade adds **full TCGA (LUAD/LUSC) expression + survival** via UCSC Xena & GDC,
and a **PubMed triage pipeline** using E-utilities (with BibTeX export).
It remains fully drivable from **Claude Code CLI** (Slash Commands + Skills).

See `workflows/WORKFLOW.md` for one-command runs; detailed prompts are in `PROMPTS.md`.
