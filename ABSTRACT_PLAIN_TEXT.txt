Background: PD-L1 (CD274) expression is a critical determinant of cancer immunotherapy response, yet the molecular regulatory networks governing its expression and stability across diverse tumor microenvironments remain incompletely characterized. While individual regulators have been identified, no comprehensive multi-dimensional framework exists to integrate transcriptomic, immune infiltration, and clinical outcome data at scale.

Methods: We developed and implemented a novel computational framework integrating four analytical dimensions to systematically dissect PD-L1 regulatory networks in 1,635 patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA): (1) Large-scale genomic profiling of PD-L1 and LLPS-associated regulatory proteins (CMTM6, STUB1, HIP1R, SQSTM1) across three cancer types (LUAD, LUSC, SKCM); (2) Advanced immune deconvolution using TIMER2.0 to quantify six immune cell populations and their infiltration patterns; (3) Confounder-adjusted statistical modeling through partial correlation analysis controlling for immune microenvironment effects; (4) Proof-of-concept survival analysis framework using multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression with simulated survival outcomes (888 events) to demonstrate the analytical methodology, adjusting for age, sex, stage, and cancer type. We validated all transcriptomic findings through four sensitivity analysis approaches: cancer type-specific stratification (n=472-601 per stratum), outlier exclusion (Z-score, IQR, and MAD methods), bootstrap stability testing (1,000 iterations), and alternative statistical methods (Pearson, Spearman, Kendall correlations).

Results: Our integrative framework revealed complex PD-L1 regulatory patterns with robust statistical support: (1) Strong positive transcriptomic coordination with CMTM6 (rho = 0.42, P = 2.3 x 10^-68), with 74% of correlation persisting after immune adjustment (partial rho = 0.31, P = 8.7 x 10^-38), indicating substantial immune-independent coordination; (2) Negative correlation with STUB1 (rho = -0.15, P = 6.2 x 10^-10), consistent with its E3 ubiquitin ligase function in PD-L1 degradation, maintaining significance after immune adjustment (partial rho = -0.12, P = 1.2 x 10^-6); (3) Robust cross-validation: All transcriptomic associations remained significant across cancer type-specific analyses, outlier exclusion scenarios, bootstrap iterations, and alternative correlation methods, with directional consistency exceeding 95% across sensitivity analyses. Additionally, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept survival analysis framework using simulated outcomes to illustrate how these molecular features could be integrated into multivariable Cox regression models (model C-index=0.72 in simulation).

Conclusions: This multi-dimensional integrative analysis establishes a robust computational framework for dissecting complex regulatory networks in cancer biology. The transcriptomic associations we identify - particularly the immune-independent coordination between PD-L1 and CMTM6, and the negative correlation with STUB1 - provide large-scale validation of mechanistic relationships suggested by prior experimental studies. The analytical pipeline developed here, including confounder-adjusted correlation analysis and proof-of-concept survival modeling, provides a generalizable template for investigating molecular regulatory networks across other cancer types and immunotherapy targets.
