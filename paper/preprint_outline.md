# Title
p62–PD‑L1 via LLPS and ubiquitin/trafficking cross‑talk: a computational–mechanistic proposal

# Abstract
(TBD by /preprint)

# Introduction
- PD‑L1 regulation overview (CMTM6/CMTM4; HIP1R; STUB1/SPOP/FBXO22; DUBs).
- Rationale for p62/SQSTM1 condensates protecting PD‑L1 from ubiquitination.

# Results (computational)
1. Evidence map (2017–2025).
2. TCGA LUAD/LUSC associations and survival.
3. Mutations/CNA integration via cBioPortal.
4. Structure/LLPS plausibility checks.

# Discussion
- Competition model: p62 LLPS vs STUB1 on PD‑L1 tail; integration with HIP1R/CMTM6 axes.
- Method caveats for LLPS (FRAP rigor; 1,6‑hexanediol specificity and alternatives).
- Experimental predictions and falsification tests.

# Methods
- E-utilities triage (query, filters, rate limits).
- Xena matrix download; GDC clinical processing; survival analysis details.
- cBioPortal REST endpoints and parameters.
- ColabFold AF‑Multimer quick protocol; LLPS heuristics.
