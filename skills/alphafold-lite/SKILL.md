# Skill: AlphaFold‑Multimer quick exploration (ColabFold)

## Purpose
Plan and run small, interpretable AF‑Multimer jobs for PD‑L1 tail × STUB1 × p62 domains; export contact maps and PAE.

## Notes
- Keep runs minimal; this is hypothesis‑generation, not structural proof.
- Save interface hypotheses and uncertainty explicitly.
